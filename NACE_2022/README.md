**ABSTRACT**

Sub-lethal exposure to environmental challenges may enhance ability to cope with repeated or novel changes,
a process known as priming. Juvenile Pacific geoduck clams were sampled and gene expression data analyzed after
acclimated at the pediveliger stage under ambient (921 µatm) and moderately-elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> (2870 µatm) for 110 days
(40-150 days post-fertilization) and subsequently after a second 7-day exposure, a 7-day recovery, and a third 7-day
exposure; exposures contained three *p*CO<sub>2</sub> treatments under the second (ambient: 754 µatm; moderately-elevated: 2750 µatm;
severely-elevated: 4940 µatm) and two *p*CO<sub>2</sub> treatments under the third (ambient: 967 µatm; moderately-elevated: 3030 µatm).
Across timepoints, pre-exposed geoducks expressed sets of genes that had higher expression relative to naïve animals.
Genes in processes identified with GO and pathway enrichment included histone methyltransferases and transcription factors,
illustrating that priming may frontload transcriptional regulation modifiers. Further, pre-exposed clams were responsive to
subsequent encounters, as functional analysis included quality control of mitochondria and immune defense under hypercapnic
seawater and energy metabolism and biosynthesis under ambient recovery. In contrast, naïve clams expressed larger sets of genes
with higher expression and were enriched for fatty-acid degradation and glutathione components at all timepoints, suggesting
depletion of endogenous fuels and unsustainable energetic requirements if changes in carbonate chemistry exacerbated or persisted.
Collectively, our transcriptomic data suggests post-larval acclimatory periods to elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH could, via gene expression
regulation, enhance robustness to environmental change in juvenile P. generosa. Such priming approaches may be beneficial for
aquaculture, as global seafood demand intensifies concurrent with environmental change.
