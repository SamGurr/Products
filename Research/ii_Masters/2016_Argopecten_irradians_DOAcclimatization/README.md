**Abstract**

Coastal hypoxia typically intensifies during summer months, but it is unknown if exposure of shellfish to diel-cycling hypoxia in early summer alters their ability to cope with prolonged and severe hypoxic events. In this study, adult bay scallops Argopecten irradians were acclimatized for 50 days at five sites with contrasting magnitudes of diurnal oxygen fluctuations, including three sites with pronounced diel-cycling hypoxia. In a laboratory experiment the effects of field acclimatization on the ability to cope with extended hypoxia was tested by exposing half of the scallops from each site to a 24-hour hypoxic event. Heartbeat rates were recorded by non-invasive infrared sensors as a proxy of whole animal metabolism in normoxic and the hypoxic treatments during the initial oxygen decline, throughout 24 hours of hypoxia, and for 1 hour after re-establishment of normoxic conditions. Scallops sustained increased heartbeat rates throughout 24 hours of severe hypoxia irrespective of acclimatization site. The magnitude of this tachycardic response varied between 27%-39% elevated heartbeat rates and a was less pronounced in scallops acclimatized at sites with pronounced diel-cycling hypoxia. Scallops naïve to severe hypoxia showed a rapid tachycardic response to hypoxia and rapid return to basal heartbeat rates once normoxia was re-established and responses were delayed and less pronounced in scallops acclimatized to pronounced diel-cycling hypoxia. Correlations between cardiac response patterns and diurnal oxygen dynamics at the five acclimatization sites suggest that frequent exposure to moderate levels of hypoxia was more important in explaining the differential response than the occasional exposure to severe hypoxia. In coastal environments where DO concentrations often change at rates >1 mg O<sub>2</sub> L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, prompt regulatory responses may be critical to sustain aerobic metabolism and ameliorate oxidative stress. Acclimatization to pronounced diel-cycling hypoxia seems to reduce responsiveness, which may be an important but poorly understood aspect of shellfish ecophysiology and resilience in dynamic coastal systems.
