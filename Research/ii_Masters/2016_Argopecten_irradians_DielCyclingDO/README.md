**Abstract**

Bottom water oxygen concentrations in coastal environments can oscillate between fully oxygenated and
hypoxic on a daily basis. How benthic organisms respond to such drastic changes in oxygen availability
is not well-understood. Specifically, we do not know the magnitude, duration, and frequency at which
diel-cycling hypoxic conditions become stressful. Here we have used non-invasive, infrared sensors to
measure the cardiac activity of the Atlantic bay scallop, Argopecten irradians, in response to diel-cycling
hypoxia in-situ over one-month periods as well as in controlled laboratory incubations using animals
conditioned to contrasting field conditions. In the field, heartbeat rates at a well-oxygenated site were
relatively constant (23.0 ± 3.4 beats minute<sup>-1</sup>) while rates were higher and more variable
(34.3 ± 7.8 beats minute<sup>-1</sup>) at sites with pronounced diel-cycling hypoxia. Maximal heartbeat rates were commonly recorded around dawn
when oxygen concentrations fell below 5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> suggesting this was a threshold concentration or critical
PO2 (Pc) that symbolized a switch to oxyconformity and onset of anaerobic pathways. In-situ cardiac activity
at locations with diel-cycling hypoxia revealed that A. irradians spent nearly 40% of each day in sub-optimal
conditions during which metabolic activity was reduced and/or at least partially sustained by anaerobic
metabolism. During laboratory experiments, an increase in heartbeat rate in response to initial declines
below 5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> from fully oxygenated conditions suggests a regulatory response in which cardiac activity
was enhanced to maintain oxygen supply.  At DO below 2 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, however, heartbeat rates declined reaching
a state of bradycardia and acardia during anoxia, suggesting a conformer response to severe hypoxia.
Heartbeat frequency was a suitable proxy for respiration under normoxia, but the heartbeat and respiration
rates decoupled during severe hypoxia (< 2.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup>).  A. irradians were able to survive anoxic periods
between 12 – 14 hours and cardiac activity rapidly returned to basal rates once full oxygen saturation was
restored. Mortality occurred after 23 – 32 hours in anoxia regardless of prior deployment conditioning.
We speculate that repetitive exposure to periods of DO oscillations with exposure below 5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> in the
field can cause sub-lethal effects to A. irradians affecting fitness, growth, and reproductive success.
