**Abstract**

Changes in salt marsh structure due to sea level rise and increasing tidal inundation appear to be associated with U.
pugnax expanding its habitat range from low to high salt marsh tidal zones (Luk and Zajac 2013). Ten Connecticut salt
marsh systems were field surveyed between June and July 2013 to determine the extent of this phenomenon. U. pugnax was
found occupying high marsh habitats in several Connecticut marsh systems in addition to the sites researched by Luk and
Zajac (2013). At sites where U. pugax abundances were present, counts per 1.0 m2 crab corrals ranged from 0.71 ± 5.98 to
43.25 ± 7.91 and 1.16 ± 0.16 to 2.60 ± 0.23 per 0.25 m2 video transect quadrats. Highest abundances were associated with
bare ground patches, however no trends were found among vegetative patch types, burrow counts, mussel counts, or
distances from low marsh habitats. Surveyed high marsh sites without U. pugnax presence had steeply sloped and narrow low
marsh habitats. These patterns reveal that the habitat expansion of U. pugnax is a complex phenomenon among salt marsh
systems. The presence of bare ground in the high marsh and the site-specific low marsh habitat availability appear to be
linked to the habitat expansion of U. pugnax populations in Connecticut salt marsh systems.

**Abstract**

Global change phenomena are shifting species distributions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We examined the expansion of the fiddler crab, Minuca pugnax (Smith 1870), into high-marsh habitats along the Connecticut, USA coast. Previously reported as primarily found in low-marsh habitats in northeastern USA, our results indicate that large populations now occupy high-marsh habitats related to increased tidal range and inundation. Where expansion was evident, high-marsh population abundances were ~2.6× that in the low marsh through the summer and fall, given the relative areas of, and densities in each. Crabs on the high marsh ranged in size from newly settled individuals to large adults, and exhibited typical feeding and reproductive behaviors. Crab numbers greatly exceed the number of burrows on the high marsh, were active during high tides, and did not retreat into burrows. Mark-recapture studies indicated crabs mostly remained in one or the other habitat, with some movement between the low and high marsh. During late fall and winter, individuals of M. pugnax are only found in the low marsh. Depending on the size of the high-marsh population that migrates into the low marsh to overwinter, this may increase intraspecific competition for available space and burrows, resulting in population bottlenecks that may affect subsequent habitat-specific population dynamics. Several severe winters during the study appear to have caused high mortality, decreasing crab abundances on the high marsh in subsequent seasons. As salt marsh environments change due to sea-level rise and other factors, resident and transient fauna may experience conditions that are, or are not, within their range of biological adaptations. *Minuca pugnax* is exhibiting a positive response to such changes in southern New England, and large populations on the high marsh during much of the year may have a significant impact on the future ecology of these ecosystems.
