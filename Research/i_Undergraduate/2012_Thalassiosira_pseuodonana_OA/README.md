**Abstract**

The effects of ocean acidification to marine organisms are not well understood. Phytoplankton are an
important component to the oceanic food chain and the effects of ocean acidification can have potential
impact on the rest of the marine food web. Not only could the increase in carbon dioxide alone affect how
phytoplankton grow, but increased carbon dioxide in the oceans can also have a direct effect on other
chemicals in the ocean (i.e, nitrogen, phosphate, copper, zinc). Most of these chemicals are either major or
minor nutrients needed by phytoplankton for growth. This experiment will investigate the effects of
different carbon dioxide (*p*CO<sub>2</sub>) exposure levels and different nitrogen compound treatments upon the
diatoms Thalassiosira weissflogii and Thalassiosira pseudonana. Results of this research show that for
both diatoms there was no significant difference in growth rate or the stoichiometry under different *p*CO<sub>2</sub>
conditions; however, there was a significant difference for both species when the nitrogen compound was
changed. Furthermore, there was a strong interaction between carbon dioxide and the nitrogen compound
