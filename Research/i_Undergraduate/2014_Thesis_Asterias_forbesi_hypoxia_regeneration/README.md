Hypoxia impacts the physiology, survival and behavior of organisms throughout the
water column (Altieri 2006; Cuomo 2005; Chabot 2008; Nilsson and Skold 1996; Parker and
O’Reilly 1991; Simpson 1994; Domenici 2007). The ophiuroid echinoderm species
Amphiura filiformis suffers decreased regeneration rate when exposed to hypoxia (Nilsson
and Skold 1996). Asterias forbesi is the dominant asteroid echinoderm species of the Long
Island Sound (LIS), a temperate marine estuary that exhibits annual hypoxic events (Parker
and O’Reilly 1991). A. forbesi were stimulated to expel a single arm (autotomy) and were
exposed to oxic (normoxia) and hypoxic conditions. A. forbesi specimen were measured at
20-day intervals to determine whether hypoxia affects their rate of regeneration. Evidence
from survival and regeneration revealed that A. forbesi is impacted most from exposure to
hypoxia during the initial days after autotomy. A. forbesi also expressed a decreased feeding
rate when exposed to hypoxia. Implications to regeneration, survival and feeding behavior
from this study provide evidence that the stress of hypoxia can reduce populations of A.
forbesi in native estuarine habitats such as LIS that express annual hypoxic conditions.
