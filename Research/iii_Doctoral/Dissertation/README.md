**ABSTRACT**

Expansion and enhancement of sustainable shellfish production is necessary to prevent overexploitation of wild stock and satisfy international trade, but hatchery rearing poses a critical bottleneck. Given that anthropogenic-environmental change is projected to intensify, long-lived molluscs, such as Pacific geoduck Panopea generosa, may rely on intragenerational acclimation to buffer against rapid change. While acute stressors can be detrimental, environmental priming can improve performance. For example, moderate oxidative stress elicits dose-dependent benefits for many taxa, however stress acclimation remains understudied in marine invertebrates, despite being threatened by climate change. To test the hypothesis that physiological status is altered by priming, we acclimatized post-larval geoduck before ambient common garden and re-exposure under two reciprocal periods of moderate and severe elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub>. Initial results showed that priming under elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> elicits compensatory carryover effects suggesting bioenergetic re-allocation facilitates growth compensation and metabolic recovery. Further, priming followed by secondary and tertiary exposure to severe and moderate elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> increased respiration rate, organic biomass, and shell size suggesting a stress-intensity-dependent effect on energetics. Moreover, primed clams had lower antioxidant capacity compared to clams under initial ambient conditions, supporting the hypothesis that early challenges affect oxidative status later in life. Transcriptomics was completed to better understand molecular underpinnings of emergent physiological phenotypes. Na√Øve clams showed a high transcriptional demand involving fatty-acid degradation and glutathione components, highlighting mobilization of endogenous lipids as a favored energy source affecting somatic growth. In contrast, the transcriptome profile was more diverse and responsive to environmental changes and under putative control of transcriptional modifiers in the primed clams, corroborating traits of emergent phenotypes to propose mechanisms underpinning beneficial developmental acclimation and resilience. Altogether, the summation of findings suggests early-life stress can trigger beneficial phenotypic variation. Thus, investigations of marine species responses to climate change should consider adaptive dose-dependent regulation and effects post-acclimation.
