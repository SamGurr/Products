**ABSTRACT**

Moderate oxidative stress is a hypothesized driver of stress tolerance and lifespan extension. Whereas thermal stress, irradiance, and dietary restriction show evidence of dose-dependent benefits for many taxa, stress acclimation remains understudied in marine mollusks, despite being threatened by climate change stressors such as ocean acidification. To test for life-stage and stress-intensity dependence in eliciting enhanced tolerance under subsequent stress encounters, we initially conditioned pediveliger Pacific geoduck clam (Panopea generosa) larvae to (i) ambient and moderately elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> (920 µatm and 2800 µatm, respectively) for 110 days, (ii) secondarily applied a 7-day exposure to ambient, moderate, and severely elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> (750 µatm, 2800 µatm, and 4900 µatm, respectively), followed by 7 days in ambient conditions, and (iii) implemented a modified-reciprocal 7-day tertiary exposure to ambient (970 µatm) and moderate *p*CO<sub>2</sub> (3000 µatm). Initial conditioning to moderate *p*CO<sub>2</sub> stress followed by secondary and tertiary exposure to severe and moderate *p*CO<sub>2</sub>2 stress increased respiration rate, organic biomass, and shell size suggesting a stress-intensity-dependent effect on energetics. Additionally, stress-acclimated clams had lower antioxidant capacity compared to clams under initial ambient conditions, supporting the hypothesis that stress over postlarval-to-juvenile development affects oxidative status later in life. We posit two subcellular mechanisms underpinning stress-intensity-dependent effects on mitochondrial pathways and energy partitioning: i) stress-induced attenuation of mitochondrial function and ii) adaptive mitochondrial shift under moderate stress. Time series and stress intensity-specific approaches can reveal life-stages and magnitudes of exposure, respectively, that may elicit beneficial phenotypic variation.
