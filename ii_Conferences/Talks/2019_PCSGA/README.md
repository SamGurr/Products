**ABSTRACT**

While acute stressors can be detrimental, environmental stress conditioning can improve performance. To test the hypothesis that physiological status is altered by stress conditioning, we subjected juvenile Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa, to repeated exposures of elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> in a commercial hatchery setting followed by a period in ambient common garden. Metabolic rate and shell length were measured for juvenile geoduck periodically throughout short-term repeated reciprocal exposure periods in ambient (~550 µatm) or elevated (~2400 µatm)  *p*CO<sub>2</sub> treatments and in common, ambient conditions, five months after exposure. Short-term exposure periods comprised of an initial 10-day exposure followed by 14 days in ambient before a secondary 6-day reciprocal exposure. The initial exposure to elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> significantly reduced metabolic rate by 25% relative to ambient conditions, but no effect on shell growth was detected. Following 14 days in common, ambient conditions, reciprocal exposure to elevated or ambient *p*CO<sub>2</sub> did not alter juvenile metabolic rates, indicating ability for metabolic recovery under subsequent conditions. Shell growth was negatively affected during the reciprocal treatment in both exposure histories, however clams exposed to the initial elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> showed compensatory growth with 5.8% greater shell growth (on average between the two secondary exposures) after five months in ambient conditions. Additionally, clams exposed to the secondary elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> showed 52.4% increase in respiration rate after five months in ambient conditions. Early exposure to low pH appears to trigger carry over effects suggesting bioenergetic re-allocation facilitates growth compensation. Life stage-specific exposures to stress can determine when it may be especially detrimental, or advantageous, to apply stress conditioning for commercial production of this long-lived burrowing clam.
