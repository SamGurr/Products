**ABSTRACT**

Oxidative stress is known to induce positive carry-over effects and is a hypothesized driver of stress “memory”
and enhanced lifespan in long-lived bivalves. Stress conditioning may induce advantageous phenotypes for sustainable
aquaculture. However, the importance of the magnitude of *p*CO<sub>2</sub> stress for establishment of stress “memory” as an acclimatory
mechanism to cope with subsequent exposure remains understudied. To test whether *p*CO<sub>2</sub> stress elicits beneficial responses
under subsequent encounters, postlarval (~30 days old) Pacific geoduck clams Panopea generosa were conditioned for 120 days
in ambient and elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (920 µatm and 2870 µatm, respectively). We then measured metabolic rate, shell length,
and total antioxidant capacity three times in a 7-day period under three *p*CO<sub>2</sub> conditions: ambient (740 ± 40 µatm), moderate
(2715 ± 70 µatm), and severe *p*CO<sub>2</sub> (4876 ± 101 µatm). Measurements were repeated during a subsequent 7-day period of ambient
recovery (861 ± 45 µatm) before reciprocal exposure to ambient (939 ± 31 µatm) and moderate (2983 ± 79 µatm) for a second
7-day period. Clams reared in elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> had greater metabolic rates and antioxidant capacity in response to moderate
*p*CO<sub>2</sub> than clams reared in ambient conditions, suggesting an effect of preconditioning on energy homeostasis and redox status.
Additionally, clams both reared under elevated *p*CO<sub>2</sub> and exposed to severe *p*CO<sub>2</sub> exhibited elevated respiration rates upon
 re-exposure to moderate *p*CO<sub>2</sub> indicating an influence of stress duration and intensity on metabolic performance.
 Intensity-specific stress conditioning reveals thresholds of exposure that may generate advantageous phenotypes for commercial
 production.
